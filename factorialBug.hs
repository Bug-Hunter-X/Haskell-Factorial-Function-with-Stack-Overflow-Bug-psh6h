The following Haskell code attempts to calculate the factorial of a number using a recursive function, but it contains a subtle bug related to pattern matching and lazy evaluation:

```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

The issue arises when a negative number is passed as an argument.  The recursion never terminates, leading to a stack overflow. The pattern matching only handles the base case of 0, and there's no explicit handling for negative inputs.
